# Boosting Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive Knowledge Distillation

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "Boosting Graph Neural Networks via Adaptive Knowledge Distillation".

## Overview

This work proposes a novel knowledge distillation framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that adaptively transfers knowledge from a teacher GNN to a student GNN. The method dynamically adjusts the knowledge transfer process based on the learning progress and graph structure, leading to improved performance with reduced computational requirements.

## Key Contributions

- **Adaptive Knowledge Distillation**: Dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer based on training progress
- **Structure-Aware Distillation**: Considers graph topology in the knowledge transfer process
- **Efficient Student Models**: Enables lightweight GNNs that maintain high performance
- **Plug-and-Play Framework**: Can be easily integrated with existing GNN architectures

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/krishnavamsis/Boosting-Graph-Neural-Networks-via-Adaptive-Knowledge-Distillation.git
cd Boosting-Graph-Neural-Networks-via-Adaptive-Knowledge-Distillation

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- PyTorch Geometric
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- tqdm

## Dataset

The implementation supports the following datasets:
- Cora
- Citeseer
- Pubmed
- ogbn-arxiv (Open Graph Benchmark)

Datasets are automatically downloaded when running the scripts.

## Usage

### Training

To train a student GNN with adaptive knowledge distillation:

```bash
python train_student.py --dataset cora --teacher_model GCN --student_model GIN --alpha 0.7 --temperature 3.0
```

### Key Arguments

- `--dataset`: Dataset name (cora, citeseer, pubmed, ogbn-arxiv)
- `--teacher_model`: Teacher GNN architecture (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE)
- `--student_model`: Student GNN architecture (GIN, GCN, MLP)
- `--alpha`: Weight for distillation loss (default: 0.7)
- `--temperature`: Temperature for soft labels (default: 3.0)
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs (default: 200)
- `--lr`: Learning rate (default: 0.01)

### Evaluation

To evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python evaluate.py --dataset cora --model_path saved_models/student_cora.pth
```

## Results

Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple graph benchmarks:

| Dataset    | Teacher Acc | Student Baseline | Ours (AKD) | Improvement |
|------------|-------------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| Cora       | 83.5%       | 79.2%            | 81.7%      | +2.5%       |
| Citeseer   | 72.8%       | 68.4%            | 70.9%      | +2.5%       |
| Pubmed     | 80.1%       | 77.3%            | 79.2%      | +1.9%       |
